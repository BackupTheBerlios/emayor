Copy the directory MunicipalityInformation to
$JBOSS_HOME$/server/default/conf/

In the end, there should be one subfolder with
the name of the municipality.

For testing, 4 subfolders for the four municipalities
are used.

Content of the municipality subfolder:

Municipality, web tier and client tier properties file,
containing text translations.

The *.service files in the municipality subfolder
describe one service.

For each supported service, there must be one
service file.
