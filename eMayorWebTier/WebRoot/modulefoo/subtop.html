This is part of the module foo.  This module uses the extension custom tags and the custom request processor.
This means that if an action URL is manually entered into the browser with the wrong protocol, the
request will be redirected to the correct protocol.  Requests to JSPs which use the pageScheme
tag will also be redirected if requested using the wrong protocol.  All other custom tags will also
function as expected.

Look at the URLs specified for each link.  Note that the correct protocol is used for each, based
on the security specification in the config files.  Note that even links between the main module and
the module foo will specify the correct protocol.
