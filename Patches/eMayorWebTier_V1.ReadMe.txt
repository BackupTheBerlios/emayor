>>>>>>>> Added Features <<<<<<<<<<

F1 Cross-border Support: The original Document can be viewed: 
	In case a document is received in a cross-border scenario, the
	List Available Document will display two buttons: "Process" and "Show Original"
	The name of the document will start with "Translated "

F2 In the Citizen Menu the submitter is not displayed as it is always the same

F3 A SignerInfo Tab is added to the applet, which displays the signature information
    from the XML document

F4 The menu Items Save and Load eMayor Forms is removed as it confuses the users
    
    
>>>>>>>>> Corrected Bugs <<<<<<<<<<<<<<

B1 Print Preview windows has missed the "Print" and "Cancel" buttons due to an overlap 
	of the text panel

B2 Save Document saves a document containing an invalid signature due to the changed schema
	locations. An instance of the original document is now saved

B3 Changing the GUI language in a document show mode redirected the browser to the index page

B4 When a request is initiated and not submitted it reappears in the List of Available 
	documents. Opening the request for a further processing throws error in the GUI. 
	A temporary solution filters out the not submitted request documents.

B5 Document View Tab displays the XML document in an inconvenient form:
	The document is now displayed formatted and indented.
	
B6 Text Boxes length are automatically increased to the longest line in the document that resulted 
	in an overlap of the box and the was cut by the View Panel. Scrolling was not convenient.
	All the Text boxes now wrap the content to the visible borders.
	
B7 Applet size was reduced to 50% by unlinking the unused packages



>>>>>>>>>>> Open Bugs (detected during the Final Review) <<<<<<<<<

B8 Changing the GUI Language when an Original Document from a cross-border scenario is displayed 
	loads the translated document instead of the original one.
B9 Applet initialization and performance speed is not acceptable or a message notifying the use about 
	the process has to be displayed.

B10 Validation of input is not always working and not on all fields

B11 Validation must not be performed on read only documents and fields
